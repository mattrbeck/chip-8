# chip-8

This is a basic Chip-8 emulator written in Crystal. Rendering is performed using SFML through CrSFML. Sound is not currently supported.

## Installation

First, you must install SFML. Next, simply clone the repo, run `shards install`, then `shards build`.

## Usage

After building, you'll be left with an executable in `bin/chip-8`. The executable takes a path to a Chip-8 rom as its only argument, so simply execute with `bin/chip-8 path/to/rom`.
